# Pet ID
Pet ID is a dog breed classification model and web application

## Running the Backend Server

This project uses [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for dependency management.
Please install Python and pip on your machine. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/irvinodjuana/pet-id.git
cd pet-id/
pip install pipenv
pipenv install --dev
```

Pipenv will now manage a virtual environment for the project.
To run commands, you can use:
```bash
pipenv run <cmd>
```
or you can create shell within the virtual environment with 
```bash
pipenv shell
```
and run commands normally.
